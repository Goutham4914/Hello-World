# Hello-World

Rolando can you please assist Goutham and work on him with this?

Hello Ralph,

We have an AP showing “DOWN” at Kinray, its AP 13 feeding from 2C port 3/16. Can you or anyone from your team try to re-patch the cable on that switchport when possible? If that doesn’t work, we’ll have net9 replace that AP when they are at Kinray to remove the old cisco AP’s.
